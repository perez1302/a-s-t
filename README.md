The link below is to access the deployed version of this program through vercel:
https://assess-sovech.vercel.app/

I created this project using visual code but it was created as a next.js project. The project was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`] on the terminal.
Project was uploaded to git vi terminal using bootstrap git push -u origin main.
Program is fully deployed and can be accessed via the above link. 
Step below is how to bootstrap via localhost

## Getting Started

First, run the development server(Such as visual code or the server you are using):

Open new terminal
npm run dev
once server is created press ctrl and click on the link provided in the terminal which shoould be like this:
ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000, url: http://localhost:3000 -> press ctrl and click on this link to open on local host.
event - compiled successfully in 2.6s (172 modules)

or 

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result once bootstrap is entered.







Thank you. It was a pleasure doing this work, I know the design may not be too good, but I promise to only better them.
